## Key Features üåü

### 1. Decentralized Subscription Management
Businesses can create and manage subscription plans that are securely stored on the Ethereum blockchain. This ensures trust, transparency, and data integrity.

### 2. Automated Invoicing
Each subscription purchase generates a tamper-proof, decentralized invoice powered by the **Request Network**. These invoices are stored immutably on IPFS, ensuring they are both secure and permanent.

### 3. Secure Payments
Accept ETH and stablecoins through a decentralized payment flow, providing a private and efficient experience for customers.

### 4. Real-Time Analytics
A user-friendly dashboard provides insights such as:
- Total revenue (all-time and monthly).
- Customer distribution across plans.
- Revenue trends over time.
- Geographical distribution of customers.

These insights help businesses make data-driven decisions and optimize their subscription offerings.
